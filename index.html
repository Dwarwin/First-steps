                <h3>Can You Get Free Games <br>For Your Iphone</h3>
                <p>LCD screens are uniquely modern in style, and the liquid crystals that make
                    them work have allowed humanity to create slimmer, more portable technology
                    than we’ve ever had access to before. From your wrist watch to your laptop,
                    a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only
                    possible because of their thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal
                    display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks in its path that
                    can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD
                    screen has allowed great leaps forward in global technological progress.</p>

                <h3>Sony Laptops Are <br>Still Part Of The Sony</h3>
                <p>Although liquid crystals are not really liquid, their molecules behave
                    more like a liquid than they do like a solid, which earns them their name.
                    The crystals in an LCD exist in a kind of a unique middle ground between
                    solid form and liquid form, which gives them the movement and flexibility
                    of a liquid; but can also let them remain in place, like a solid. Heat can
                    quickly melt a solid to liquid, allowing it to move, whereas cool will make
                    the liquid solidify almost instantly. The sensitivity of liquid crystals to
                    temperature can be an advantage, or a disadvantage. It allows for the highly
                    successful use of liquid crystals in devices like thermometers, where
                    temperature responsiveness is a boon; but this same property can unfortunately
                    make LCD screens unreliable in extreme climates.</p>

                <h3>Video Games Playing <br>With Imagination</h3>
                <p>In an LCD screen, electric currents work at a microscopic level to
                    control the amount of light that passes through the liquid crystal
                    molecules that make up the moving layer of the screen, which is
                    sandwiched between clear glass panels. The currents can force the
                    naturally twisted molecules to unwind or coil tighter, thereby changing
                    the amount of light that can pass from the bulb behind the glass to
                    the eye of the viewer. It may help you understand this process by
                    imagining that light filters through an LCD screen the same way
                    that sunlight filters through the leaves of a tree. Now, imagine
                    that the tree is being blown in the wind, and you will see that the
                    amount and placement of the light that comes through the leaves changes.
                    This is very similar to the dynamic that powers an LCD screen, except
                    that the sun is a small light bulb, the leaves are molecules of liquid
                    crystal, and the wind is made up of electric currents sent by the
                    computer and designed to create a specific light pattern that your eye
                    will interpret as words or images.</p>
